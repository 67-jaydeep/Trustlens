## Overview

TRUSTLENS v1 uses seven explainable trust-risk signals.

Each signal:
- Is independent
- Produces a normalized risk value (0.0 – 1.0)
- Includes explanation
- Includes known limitations

Signals indicate observable risk patterns — not truth.

# SIGNAL DEFINITIONS

---

## 1. Emotional Language Density

Signal ID: emotion_density

Purpose:
Identify disproportionate emotional framing relative to informational content.

Measures:
Frequency of emotionally charged words compared to total word count.

Why It Matters:
High emotional intensity can influence reader perception
and reduce analytical scrutiny.

Risk Contribution:
Higher emotional density → higher trust risk.

Limitations:
- Emotional journalism may score higher.
- Cultural tone differences are not fully captured.

---

## 2. Sensational Headline Patterns

Signal ID: sensational_headline

Purpose:
Detect click-driven or curiosity-gap headline structures.

Measures:
Pattern matches such as:
- Rhetorical questions
- Vague promises
- Shock-driven phrasing

Why It Matters:
Headlines strongly bias interpretation before evidence is evaluated.

Risk Contribution:
More sensational structure → higher trust risk.

Limitations:
- Opinion or marketing content may trigger.
- Pattern matching is language-dependent.

---

## 3. Claim-to-Source Ratio

Signal ID: claim_source_ratio

Purpose:
Evaluate balance between factual claims and supporting references.

Measures:
Ratio of declarative claims to citations, links, named references, or dates.

Why It Matters:
Low-trust content often makes many claims with minimal sourcing.

Risk Contribution:
More claims with fewer sources → higher trust risk.

Limitations:
- Not all claims require citation.
- Some valid sources may be implicit or offline.

---

## 4. Readability vs Persuasion Imbalance

Signal ID: readability_persuasion

Purpose:
Detect imbalance between persuasive tone and informational depth.

Measures:
- Sentence simplicity
- Repetition patterns
- Strength of conclusions

Why It Matters:
Manipulative content often prioritizes persuasion over explanation.

Risk Contribution:
Higher persuasion dominance → higher trust risk.

Limitations:
- Educational summaries may appear simplified.
- Readability alone does not imply manipulation.

---

## 5. Content Originality Heuristics

Signal ID: content_originality

Purpose:
Identify templated or mass-produced structural patterns.

Measures:
- Generic transitions
- Repetitive structure
- Low specificity markers

Why It Matters:
Low originality correlates with scaled content production
and SEO-driven content farms.

Risk Contribution:
Lower originality → higher trust risk.

Limitations:
- Journalism templates are common.
- Structural similarity does not imply low quality.

---

## 6. AI-Likeness Risk Pattern

Signal ID: ai_likeness_risk

Purpose:
Identify stylistic traits commonly associated with AI-assisted writing.

Measures:
- High fluency with low specificity
- Balanced but shallow arguments
- Repetitive sentence structures
- Lack of experiential markers

Why It Matters:
AI-assisted content increases scale and impersonality,
which may increase misinformation velocity.

Risk Contribution:
Higher AI-likeness patterns → higher trust risk.

Important:
This signal does NOT claim AI authorship.

Limitations:
- Humans can write similarly to AI.
- AI-generated text can be edited.

---

## 7. Structural Transparency

Signal ID: structural_transparency

Purpose:
Evaluate presence of accountability markers.

Measures:
Presence of:
- Author name
- Publication date
- External links
- Disclosures or corrections

Why It Matters:
High-trust content usually exposes authorship and sourcing context.

Risk Contribution:
Lower transparency → higher trust risk.

Limitations:
- Anonymous content may be legitimate.
- Some platforms hide metadata.

---

# Aggregation Note

Signals are grouped and aggregated conservatively.

Within correlated groups:
- Maximum value is used (not sum).

Final output:
- LOW
- MEDIUM
- HIGH

No signal alone determines outcome.

---

# Explicitly Out of Scope (v1)

- Factual verification
- Political bias classification
- Author reputation scoring
- ML-based semantic inference
- AI authorship detection

---

# Final Statement

TRUSTLENS evaluates observable trust-risk patterns.
It does not determine truth.

Human judgment remains essential.
