SECTION G — USERS & USE CASES
TRUSTLENS Phase 1 Research
Q36. Who is the primary user of TRUSTLENS?

Short Answer
The primary user of TRUSTLENS is a developer, independent journalist, or small publisher who wants insight into content trust signals without relying on black-box AI.

Explanation
These users:

publish or analyze content regularly,

lack access to expensive tools,

value transparency and control,

are comfortable interpreting explanations.

TRUSTLENS is not designed for casual consumers seeking simple yes/no answers.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
The system prioritizes clarity, explanations, and tooling, not mass-market simplicity.

Known Limitation
Non-technical users may find outputs overwhelming.

Q37. What decision is the user trying to make using TRUSTLENS?

Short Answer
The user is deciding whether content requires further scrutiny before trust, publication, or sharing.

Explanation
TRUSTLENS supports decisions such as:

“Should I investigate this further?”

“Should I add sources or context?”

“Is this framing too manipulative?”

“Should this be published as-is?”

It does not make decisions on behalf of the user.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Outputs are advisory and framed as guidance, not commands.

Known Limitation
Users seeking definitive answers may feel unsupported.

Q38. How should uncertainty be communicated to users?

Short Answer
Uncertainty should be communicated explicitly, repeatedly, and consistently.

Explanation
Uncertainty is inherent due to:

heuristic analysis,

lack of external verification,

cultural and contextual variance.

Clear language reduces misuse and over-trust.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Every report includes:

scope disclaimers,

signal limitations,

explanation of what the system does not know.

Known Limitation
Repeated disclaimers may reduce perceived confidence.

Q39. What misuse scenarios must be anticipated?

Short Answer
Potential misuse includes treating TRUSTLENS as an authority or weaponizing scores.

Explanation
Misuse scenarios:

using scores to suppress content,

presenting scores as proof of falsehood,

comparing scores across unrelated content,

ignoring explanations in favor of numbers.

Anticipating misuse is part of responsible design.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Language, UI, and documentation discourage authoritative interpretation.

Known Limitation
Misuse cannot be fully prevented in open systems.

Q40. How can TRUSTLENS remain advisory rather than authoritative?

Short Answer
By framing outputs as signals, explanations, and prompts for human judgment.

Explanation
Authoritative systems:

issue verdicts,

hide uncertainty,

discourage questioning.

Advisory systems:

explain reasoning,

expose limitations,

invite interpretation.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
TRUSTLENS avoids verdict language and emphasizes interpretability.

Known Limitation
Advisory systems may appear weaker than assertive tools.
