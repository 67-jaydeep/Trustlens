SECTION B — MISINFORMATION LANDSCAPE
TRUSTLENS Phase 1 Research
Q8. What are the most common real-world forms of misinformation?

Short Answer
The most common forms of misinformation are not outright falsehoods, but distorted presentations of real information.

Explanation
In practice, misinformation frequently appears as:

Selective truth (only favorable facts shown)

Context stripping (removing time, conditions, or scope)

Exaggerated conclusions (weak evidence → strong claims)

Speculative content framed as certainty

Recycled or outdated information presented as current

These forms are difficult to classify as “false” but still mislead audiences.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
TRUSTLENS focuses on presentation patterns and structural signals, not factual validation.

Known Limitation
Some distortion techniques require external context to detect.

Q9. How does sensationalism mislead without lying?

Short Answer
Sensationalism exaggerates emotional impact and certainty without altering factual statements.

Explanation
Sensational content:

amplifies fear, outrage, or excitement,

uses extreme adjectives,

emphasizes unlikely consequences,

prioritizes emotional reaction over clarity.

Even accurate facts can become misleading when framed sensationally.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Emotional intensity and headline patterns are treated as risk indicators, not evidence of falsehood.

Known Limitation
Legitimate breaking news and opinion writing may appear sensational.

Q10. How does framing influence reader perception?

Short Answer
Framing shapes how information is interpreted before evidence is evaluated.

Explanation
Framing techniques include:

headline priming,

selective emphasis,

ordering of information,

omission of counterpoints.

Readers often form conclusions from framing alone, independent of factual detail.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Headline analysis and structural cues are critical trust signals.

Known Limitation
Subtle framing bias is difficult to measure quantitatively.

Q11. What is authority laundering and how is it used?

Short Answer
Authority laundering is the practice of invoking credibility without providing verifiable attribution.

Explanation
Common forms include:

“Experts say…”

“Scientists confirm…”

“Studies show…” (no citation)

This creates perceived legitimacy while avoiding accountability.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Signals evaluate presence and specificity of sources, not their correctness.

Known Limitation
Not all legitimate sources are publicly linkable.

Q12. How does omission of context create misinformation?

Short Answer
By removing qualifiers, limitations, or timelines, content can drastically change meaning without lying.

Explanation
Context omission includes:

removing study limitations,

ignoring timeframe relevance,

excluding alternative explanations.

This creates misleading narratives through incompleteness.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Content with high claim density and low contextual markers increases trust risk.

Known Limitation
Full context may not be inferable from text alone.

Q13. How does engagement-driven content differ from informational content?

Short Answer
Engagement-driven content prioritizes attention and interaction over understanding.

Explanation
Engagement-driven content often:

uses curiosity gaps,

relies on repetition,

simplifies nuance,

encourages sharing over reflection.

Informational content prioritizes clarity, sourcing, and nuance.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Signals identify engagement optimization patterns as trust-risk indicators.

Known Limitation
High engagement does not always imply low trust.
