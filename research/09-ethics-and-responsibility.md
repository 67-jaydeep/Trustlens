SECTION I — ETHICS & RESPONSIBILITY
TRUSTLENS Phase 1 Research
Q46. Could TRUSTLENS be misused for censorship?

Short Answer
Yes. Any trust-scoring system can be misused to justify suppression if treated as authoritative.

Explanation
Potential misuse includes:

platforms blocking content based on scores,

bad actors weaponizing scores against viewpoints,

overreliance on numeric outputs.

This risk exists regardless of intent.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
TRUSTLENS must explicitly state that it is advisory, not enforceable.

Known Limitation
Open systems cannot fully prevent misuse.

Q47. Who owns the interpretation of trust scores?

Short Answer
The user owns the interpretation, not the system.

Explanation
TRUSTLENS provides:

signals,

explanations,

limitations.

Interpretation requires human judgment and context.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
The system avoids prescriptive language and verdicts.

Known Limitation
Users may still treat outputs as authoritative.

Q48. How can bias be introduced through signal selection?

Short Answer
Bias can arise from cultural assumptions, language norms, and weighting choices.

Explanation
Bias sources include:

English-centric heuristics,

Western journalism norms,

emotional tone assumptions,

selection of what counts as “risk”.

No signal set is neutral.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Signal definitions and limitations are documented transparently.

Known Limitation
Bias cannot be fully eliminated, only mitigated.

Q49. How should limitations be communicated transparently?

Short Answer
Limitations should be communicated clearly, repeatedly, and in-context.

Explanation
Effective communication includes:

documentation sections,

inline UI disclaimers,

per-signal limitations.

Hidden limitations undermine trust.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Limitations are first-class output, not footnotes.

Known Limitation
Users may ignore documentation.

Q50. What ethical boundaries must TRUSTLENS clearly state?

Short Answer
TRUSTLENS must clearly state what it will not do.

Explanation
Boundaries include:

no truth determination,

no political judgment,

no censorship enforcement,

no AI authorship claims,

no user surveillance.

Clear boundaries protect users and developers.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Ethical boundaries are documented and visible.

Known Limitation
Boundaries do not control external use.
