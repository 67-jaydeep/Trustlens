SECTION C — HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY & MANIPULATION
TRUSTLENS Phase 1 Research
Q14. Which cognitive biases are most exploited by low-trust content?

Short Answer
Low-trust content commonly exploits negativity bias, authority bias, confirmation bias, and availability bias.

Explanation

Negativity bias: People react more strongly to threats and losses than neutral information.

Authority bias: Statements attributed to “experts” or institutions are trusted without verification.

Confirmation bias: Content aligning with existing beliefs is accepted more readily.

Availability bias: Vivid or recent examples feel more representative than they are.

Manipulative content is designed to trigger these biases simultaneously.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Signals focus on linguistic and structural triggers that activate these biases.

Known Limitation
Bias exploitation varies across individuals and cultures.

Q15. Why does emotional language bypass rational evaluation?

Short Answer
Emotional language activates affective processing, reducing analytical scrutiny.

Explanation
Emotionally charged words:

increase cognitive load,

create urgency,

shorten attention spans,

discourage counter-analysis.

This makes readers more susceptible to accepting claims without evidence evaluation.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Emotional density is treated as a risk amplifier, not proof of misinformation.

Known Limitation
Emotional expression can be appropriate in personal or humanitarian contexts.

Q16. Why does confident, fluent writing feel more believable?

Short Answer
Fluency creates an illusion of truth by reducing cognitive effort.

Explanation
When text is:

grammatically clean,

well-structured,

assertive in tone,

readers perceive it as more credible due to cognitive ease, not accuracy.

This effect is amplified by AI-assisted writing.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
High fluency combined with low sourcing increases trust risk.

Known Limitation
Professional journalism is also fluent and well-structured.

Q17. How do fear and urgency affect user judgment?

Short Answer
Fear and urgency compress decision-making time, bypassing verification.

Explanation
Urgent phrasing (“act now”, “before it’s too late”):

discourages fact-checking,

increases emotional response,

accelerates sharing behavior.

Fear-based narratives spread faster regardless of accuracy.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Urgency cues are identified as behavior-shaping risk signals.

Known Limitation
Breaking news may legitimately require urgency.

Q18. How do repetition and simplicity influence belief formation?

Short Answer
Repeated and simplified statements feel more truthful over time.

Explanation

Repetition increases familiarity.

Simplicity reduces cognitive resistance.

This combination leads to belief reinforcement even without evidence.

Design Implication for TRUSTLENS
Repetitive phrasing and oversimplified structures increase trust risk.

Known Limitation
Educational material may intentionally simplify concepts.
